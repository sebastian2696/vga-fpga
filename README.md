# FPGA VGA 

Implementation of a Image Display using an FPGA. 
Designed for use on a [Basys 2 FPGA Board](https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-2-spartan-3e-fpga-trainer-board-limited-time/)

UCF file included in each folder will map the pins to to the Basys 2.

In the future, I will prodive the bitstream files as well as an update
for PYNQ board using HDMI.
